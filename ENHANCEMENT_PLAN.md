# AI-Enhanced Weather App Roadmap

## Vision
Transform the weather app into an immersive 3D experience with AI-generated animations that reflect real-time weather conditions for any city worldwide.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection
- [ ] Add more weather parameters (humidity, pressure, UV index, air quality)
- [ ] Integrate time-of-day and seasonal data
- [ ] Add city landmarks/geography data for context

## Phase 2: AI Integration Options

### Option A: Text-to-3D Generation
- **Service**: Spline AI, Luma AI, or Meshy
- **Flow**: Weather description → 3D scene generation
- **Example**: "Snowy evening in Mohe" → 3D winter scene

### Option B: Weather-to-Animation Mapping
- **Service**: Three.js + AI-generated assets
- **Flow**: Weather code → Pre-generated 3D animations
- **Example**: Snow code → Falling snow particles + winter landscape

### Option C: Real-time AI Generation
- **Service**: OpenAI DALL-E 3 + Three.js conversion
- **Flow**: Weather + City → AI image → 3D scene
- **Example**: "Mohe winter scene with heavy snow" → 3D environment

## Phase 3: Implementation Strategy

### Backend Enhancements
1. **New Controller**: `WeatherVisualizationController`
2. **AI Service**: Integration with chosen AI provider
3. **Caching**: Store generated animations for performance
4. **Asset Management**: Handle 3D models and textures

### Frontend Transformation
1. **3D Engine**: Three.js or Babylon.js
2. **UI/UX**: Modern interface with 3D viewport
3. **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly 3D interactions
4. **Performance**: Optimized loading and rendering

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time weather updates in 3D
- [ ] Interactive city exploration
- [ ] Weather forecasts with animated transitions
- [ ] Social sharing of 3D weather scenes
- [ ] Voice narration of weather conditions
